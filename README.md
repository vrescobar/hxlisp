# hxlisp

hxlisp is a metacircular evaluator of lisp implemented on top of haxe.
Currently it is not yet working and it is a work in progress for my own learning of haxe and lisp.


## Which lisp will be implemented?

In the first version I expect to implement the seven primitives of lisp:
- atom
- quote
- eq
- car
- cdr
- cons
- cond

I also expect to implement at least the next ones in pure haxe:
- define
- lambda
-  let

## Will you also implement....?

First I want to finish the basic features, including a REPL and some decent test cases.
